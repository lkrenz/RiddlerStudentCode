| Aug 22 | 30 Minutes in class |                                                                                                                                                       I spent this time figuring out the encryption for the first three passages |
| Aug 22 |      6:30-7:00      | Started coding the methods for part one and two. I didn't quite finish because I kept having to look up java syntax (It's been a while). Also, I can't tell if the functions will run because I'm running into an issue with JDK |
| Aug 22 |      7:00-7:15      |                                                                                             Finished writing code for the second and third passages. I will keep working on this tomorrow once I figure out how to run the code. |
